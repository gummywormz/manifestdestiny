Z to shoot, X to shift position, Arrow keys to move

Your goal is to make it through 5 levels without losing all your lives. Use your horses to protect your vehicle. You can switch positions to change your speed, your horses' location, and your firing pattern. Power ups are new weapons are also available. Your horses have more health than your vehicle, so it is best to tank hits with them rather than your wagon. 

POWER UPS:
1 Up (o) - Increases your lives by 1. Also available every 10000 points.
(R)apid Fire - Increases the fire rate of your horses.
Horse Health Up (+) - Adds health to your remaining horses.

WEAPONS: 
(N)ormal - Your standard weapon
(S)pread - Fires 3 shots straight ahead.
(W)ave - Your shots go wildly in a wave pattern
(P)lasma - Your shots split after hitting an enemy.
(B)urst - Fires many shots in random directions.


NOTE: After clicking play on Greenfoot, you must wait about 1 minute or so before clicking play in the actual game.
I added a loading routine so the game won't be a horribly slow mess while playing it.

NOTE 2: This game requires Greenfoot to compile. If you don't have Greenfoot installed, one can simply just use the .jar file to run the game.
